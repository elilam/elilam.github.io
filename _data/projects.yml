  name: 'Radiative and Non-radiative decay of square planar transition metal complexes'
  description: >
    My Ph.D. thesis explores the use of computational analysis with DFT and TDDFT to understand the structure 
    and property relationships of luminescent square planar transtition metal complexes with tridentate ligands.
