  name: 'Design, Synthesis, Photophysical Measurements and Device Fabrication of Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes'
  description: >
    The third part of my research project focuses on the experimental studies of the luminescent Platinum(II) complexes with cyclometalated ligands. With the highly luminescent properties, these complexes have then been ultilized in the fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with good performance. Moreover, the emissive color can be tuned with proper modification of the coordinated ligands.
