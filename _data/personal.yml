intro:
  title: Welcome!
  body: >
    I'm a chemistry graduate student at the 
    [Chemistry Department in The University of Hong Kong](http://www.chemistry.hku.hk/index_home.php)
    in the field of computational chemistry / inorganic chemistry. 
    In particular, most of my research work has been focusing on the computational study of the electronic 
    structure and excited state properties of metal complexes with some of them as potential organogelators 
    and emitters in organic light-emitting diodes. <br>
    <br>
    Prior to the entrance of my Bachelor of Science degree, I was fortunate enough to have been involved in 
    engineering projects on sustainable development and energy efficiencies with the [Mechanical Engineering
    Department of The University of Hong Kong](http://hkumea.hku.hk/). 
    These experiences, together with the inspiration from my Physics undergraduate studies, 
    have laid my interests in applying fundamental scientific knowledge into real-life implementation
    of technology.<br>
    <br>
    In view of the usage of LED lights as one of the energy saving practices, my PhD pursuit is primarily 
    on the design and development of light-emitting materials for energy efficient organic light-emitting 
    devices (OLEDs). 
    In my research study, I first kicked off with experimental synthetic studies of luminescent complexes. 
    During the synthesis and measurements experiments, I have noticed the different emission
    behaviors of my synthesized metal complexes. My curiosity has driven me to consult computational 
    experts internally and externally and investigate on the photophysical behaviors and processes. 
    These experiences have gradually led me to computational study of photophysical processes of the 
    complexes which has further inspired me to the road in computational chemistry.<br>
    <br>
    I wish to employ my multidisciplinary mentality and strong analytical ability from physics,
    chemistry and engineering trainings to search for new insights and solutions to real-life issues 
    and problems in various areas including scientific and non-scientific fields.
