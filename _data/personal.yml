intro:
  title: About Elizabeth
  body: >
    After graduating from her PhD in Chemistry, Elizabeth worked for nearly three years in an analytical laboratory. As a research and development chemist, she has majored in method development for pesticides and drugs in food and water. Also as the chair of a graduate student collaboration blog, Chembites, she shares the excitement in research with a broad audience. Following her passion for science, Elizabeth has extended her interest from her specialization to various fields of science. She is now pursuing a career as a science writer and following her curiosity to discover more wonders in the world.

When not reading and writing about science, Elizabeth would put on her sports shoes for some walks in nature. She is always attracted by the blue sky and natural landscapes that push her to go out and explore. <br>
