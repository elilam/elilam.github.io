intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I enjoy learning new things and accepting new challenges. This is this pursue, I am fortunate enough to 
    enjoy a chapter after a chapter, from undergraduate physics, to PhD study in inorganic and computational chemistry,
    and now a reserach and development chemist in the field of analytical chemistry in a commercial testing laboratory. <br>

    ##**More about me**
    <br><br>
    Prior to the entrance of my Bachelor of Science degree, I was fortunate enough to have been involved in 
    engineering projects on sustainable development and energy efficiencies with the 
    Mechanical Engineering Department of The University of Hong Kong. These experiences, 
    together with the inspiration from my Physics undergraduate studies, have laid my interests in 
    applying fundamental scientific knowledge into real-life implementation of technology.<br><br>
    My PhD pursuit is primarily on the design and development of light-emitting materials for energy efficient organic light-emitting 
    devices (OLEDs). I first kicked off with experimental synthetic studies of luminescent complexes. 
    Throughout synthesis and measurements experiments, I have noticed the different emission
    behaviors of my synthesized metal complexes. My curiosity has driven me to consult computational 
    experts internally and externally and investigate on the photophysical behaviors and processes. 
    These experiences have gradually led me to computational study of photophysical processes of the 
    complexes which has further inspired me to the road in computational chemistry.<br><br>
    After my PhD study, I decided to extend my research interests beyond academia. I'm now in charge for developing 
    new methods for testing in various fields such as pesticides in food and pollutants in air or exahust. 
    <br><br>
    I would like to employ my multidisciplinary mentality and strong analytical ability from physics,
    chemistry and engineering trainings to search for new insights and solutions to real-life issues 
    and problems in various areas including scientific and non-scientific fields.
