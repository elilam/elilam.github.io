intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a chemistry graduate student at the 
    [Chemistry Department in The University of Hong Kong](http://www.chemistry.hku.hk/index_home.php).
    My research includes experimental and computational studies of 
    luminescent transition metal complexes.
    My projects are aimed at characterizing the photophysical properties of 
    gold and platinum inorganic complexes.
    Currently, I'm excited about applying computational techniques of molecular dynamics on
    the calculations of the excited states.
