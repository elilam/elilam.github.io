intro:
  title: Welcome!
  body: >
    I'm a chemistry graduate student at the 
    [Chemistry Department in The University of Hong Kong](http://www.chemistry.hku.hk/index_home.php)
    in the field of computational chemistry / inorganic chemistry. 
    In particular, most of my research work has been focusing on the computational study of the electronic 
    structure and excited state properties of metal complexes with some of them as potential organogelators 
    and emitters in organic light-emitting diodes. <br>
    <br>
    I first kicked off with experimental synthetic studies of luminescent complexes. 
    During the synthesis and measurements experiments, I have noticed the different emission
    behaviors of my synthesized metal complexes. My curiosity has driven me to consult computational 
    experts internally and externally and investigate on the photophysical behaviors and processes. 
    These experiences have gradually led me to computational study of photophysical processes of the 
    complexes which has further inspired me to the road in computational chemistry.
